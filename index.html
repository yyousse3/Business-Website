        <h5>Founder</h5>
        <p>Hello, my name is Roberto Gomez. I was born in Santa Marta, Colombia. When I was young, around 5 years old, my parents and I moved to London Ontario. I was blessed with this decision by my parents, as I felt like I had a huge opportunity to do something big here. I was not going let the opportunity slip away from me, so I decided to create the company Snooze. Ever since then, I have not looked back since.</p>

        <h5>CEO</h5>
        <p>Hello, my name is Joseph Taliman. I was born in Goderich, Ontario. Growing up in a smaller city where many people are not able to make it out was my driving motivation. So being able to be the CEO of this new and growing company was a huge honour for me. I strive to help make this company bigger and better than it is already.</p>
